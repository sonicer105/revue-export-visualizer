# Revue Export Visualizer

I created a tool for visualizing the JSON export from Revue by Twitter

I wrote this in an hour to help a friend out. It can probably be improved but the code has already served it's purpose.

Has to be run on a web server due to CORS limitations.

Simple replace the items.json file with your own and open index.html. You can then save the resulting static page using your browser's save function.

This tool is meant to help people visualize their data so they can transfer it to a different service or CMS.
